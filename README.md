# Minecraft Shaders for Minecraft

There are so many shader packs and mods out there that the Shaders Mod might easily be overlooked by players who search using more specific terms. This mod, authored by karyonix, is actually a fine shader mod that adds a special shadow map to the world to complement the light map which is already there. There are actually normal maps and specular maps to consider too, because the Shaders Mod allows you to change the appearance of your Minecraft world in some unexpected ways by modifying these aspects of the game, which you may not have even realized existed without this mod.

<b>Shaders Mod</b> adds shaders to Minecraft and add multiple draw buffers, shadow map, normal map, specular map. These things can be used to change appearance of Minecraft world. How it looks depends on selected shaderpack and some user settings.
